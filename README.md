## Functionalities

1. ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.

2. ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.

3. ensures the menu element is hidden by default. 

4.  ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.

5. ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single entry element in the feed .

6. ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
